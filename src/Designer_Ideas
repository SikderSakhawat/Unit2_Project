Variables:
We need a private variable for the first x and y values, along with the second x and y values
    make a "delta x/y" method to return the values of deltaX and deltaY
    store these delta values as doubles, then create a slope method to find the value of the slope
    have the value of the slope stored in another value, or have it returned in a method

Methods
make a method that can return the y intercept (maybe use one of our equations and work it out to find out the "b" value
make a method that can create the formula of the slope in slope-intercept form
    this will probably be a string, concatenated with the value of the slope and the y intercept
have a method that can take a double integer, use other methods stated beforehand to return a value using that specific slope-intercept formula

toString method
import scanner class
(should be in main method?) ask for the first x and y coordinates, then ask for second x and y coordinates
    have the strings asked set to a variable (that will be used with our methods given)
have it display my first and second ordered pair
display the slope of my line
display the y-intercept
display the equation in slope intercept form
display the distance between the points given
Ask to enter an x-value
use a method to return the ordered pair after you ask for a number to plug into the equation

Implementation/nitty gritty things
We need to figure out how to parse the string to only get the integer from it
    Probably use a substring method, then use a math static method to figure out how to change the string into an int
Using a method as a "distance formula" calculator, will return a double
