Variables:
We need a private variable for the first x and y values, along with the second x and y values
    have the value of the slope stored in another value, or have it returned in a method

Methods
CONSTRUCTOR: LinearEquation(int initialX, int initialY, int finalX, int finalY) [DONE]
findSlope(int initialX, int initialY, int finalX, int finalY) // should work with how our object takes in values for our constructor
    method to find your slope

yIntercept(double yValue, double xValue, double slope); [DONE]
    double b = y - m*x; // just use the x1 and y1 values to figure this out, after finding the value of the slope
    make a method that can return the y intercept (maybe use one of our equations and work it out to find out the "b" value)

public void printSlopeFormula(double slope, double yIntercept) [DONE]
make a method that can create the formula of the slope in slope-intercept form
    this will probably be a string, concatenated with the value of the slope and the y intercept (void?)

calcValue(double value) [DONE]
    have a method that can take a double integer, use other methods stated beforehand to return a value using that specific slope-intercept formula
    this will probably use yIntercept() and findSlope() to calculate the value based on the slope intercept formula

toString() method
import scanner class
(should be in main method?) ask for the first x and y coordinates, then ask for second x and y coordinates
    have the strings asked set to a variable (that will be used with our methods given)
have it display my first and second ordered pair
display the slope of my line
display the y-intercept
display the equation in slope intercept form
display the distance between the points given
Ask to enter an x-value
use a method to return the ordered pair after you ask for a number to plug into the equation

Implementation/nitty gritty things
We need to figure out how to parse the string to only get the integer from it
    Probably use a substring method, then use a math static method to figure out how to change the string into an int (parseint)
Using a method as a "distance formula" calculator, will return a double
Probably put some awesome border designs so the design of my output looks awesome
